Project Brief: Top Trumps In this project you'll create a small game where players compare stats.
The basic flow of the games is:
1. You are given a random card with different stats
2. You select one of the card's stats
3. Another random card is selected for your opponent (the computer)
4. The stats of the two cards are compared
5. The player with the stat higher than their opponent wins

Required Tasks
These are the required tasks for this project:
1. Generate a random number between 1 and 151 to use as the Pokemon ID number
2. Using the Pokemon API get a Pokemon based on its ID number
3. Create a dictionary that contains the returned Pokemon's name, id, height and weight.
4. Get a random Pokemon for the player and another for their opponent
5. Ask the user which stat they want to use (id, height or weight)
6. Compare the player's and opponent's Pokemon on the chosen stat to decide who wins

Ideas for Extending the Project
Here are a few ideas for extending the project beyond the required tasks:
● Use different stats for the Pokemon from the API
● Get multiple random Pokemon and let the player decide which one that they want to use
● Play multiple rounds and record the outcome of each round. The player with the most rounds won, wins the game
● Allow the opponent (computer) to choose a stat that they would like to compare
● Record high scores for players and store them in a file

MoSCoW Technique

Must have (Top Priority) - Non-negotiable
- All Project Brief Required elements

Should have - Important initiatives that are not vital but add value
- Ask the user if they want to know how the game works before playing
- Give the user the choice of multiple Pokemon to choose from
- Give the user the choice to see the Pokemon's stats before they decide which one to play with

Could have - Nice to have initiatives that will have a small impact if left out
- Play 3 rounds (best of 3)

Won't have - Initiatives that are not priority for the time frame
- Allow the opponent (computer) to choose a stat that they would like to compare
- Record High scores for players and store them in a file (would need a lot of rounds)
