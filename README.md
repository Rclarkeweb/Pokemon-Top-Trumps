# Pokémon Top Trumps Game

A Python3 Terminal/shell based text game using the Pokémon API.
It was created as part of the [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) Python and Apps course.
This was an 8 week course that taught us how to code with Python. We had to create a final project and present it. 

  
You can read the Project Brief [here](https://github.com/Rclarkeweb/Pokemon-Top-Trumps/blob/main/Project%20Brief.txt).

## Tech used

All code uses Python 3.
Also uses the Python Modules:
- Requests (for the API)
- Random (to generate a random ID number)
- Time (to add a time delay in the text appearance)
